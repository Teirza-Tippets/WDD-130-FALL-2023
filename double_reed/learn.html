            <h2>Prices</h2>
            <h4>Oboe:</h4>
            <p>The price of an oboe can vary significantly based on factors like the brand, quality, materials, 
                and country of manufacture. Additionally, the cost of reeds also varies depending on whether you 
                buy pre-made reeds or make your own. Here are some general price ranges for beginner to intermediate 
                oboes and reeds:
            </p>    
            <p>Beginner Oboes:
                Student oboes designed for beginners are typically made of resin or plastic, which is more durable and less expensive than wooden oboes.
                Prices for beginner oboes can range from approximately $500 to $1,500 or more, depending on the brand and features.
                Keep in mind that some oboes in this price range may be used or refurbished, which can offer good value for a beginner.</p>
            <p>Intermediate-level:
                Oboes are often made of higher-quality materials, such as grenadilla wood, which can improve tone and playability.
                Prices for intermediate oboes can range from $2,000 to $5,000 or more, depending on factors like the brand, craftsmanship, and additional features.
                These oboes are suitable for advancing students and can be used by serious hobbyists or semi-professional musicians.
                </p>
                
            <p>Reeds:
                Oboe reeds are a recurring expense for oboists as they need to be replaced regularly due to wear and tear.
                Prices for pre-made oboe reeds can vary from around $10 to $30 per reed, with hand-crafted reeds at the higher end 
                of the price range. These reeds can be purchased individually or in packs. Some oboists choose to make their own reeds, 
                which involves purchasing cane, tools, and supplies. The initial investment in reed-making equipment can vary but is 
                generally in the range of $100 to $300. It's essential to consider the quality and playability of an oboe 
                when making a purchase, as well as the reputation of the brand and the instrument's condition if buying used. 
                When it comes to reeds, many oboists prefer to work with an oboe teacher or professional to find or make reeds that 
                suit their playing style and preferences.</p>
                
            <h4>Please note that prices can change over time, and it's advisable to research specific models, 
            brands, and market conditions when shopping for oboes and reeds. Additionally, consider the cost of
            maintenance, repairs, and accessories like cases and cleaning supplies when budgeting for your oboe playing journey.</h4>

            <p>Intermediate Bassoons:
                Intermediate-level bassoons are typically made of higher-quality materials such as maple wood or other 
                hardwoods, which can enhance tone and playability. Prices for intermediate bassoons can range from $5,000
